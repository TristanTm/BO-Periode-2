## Amsterdamse havenstad
## Amsterdam port & city

## connected through the ages
### On the basis of various objects and stories, which happened in specific places in the harbour and the city, the visitor is taken into the present, past and future of the connection between the harbour and the city. The exhibition starts in the 13th century and ends with a look at the future. In the first period, the formation of the city and the harbour are central. Archaeological finds illustrate how Amsterdam and its harbour developed into the most important port in the Netherlands. In the period after that, from 1600 to 1800, the harbour and city even developed into a gateway to the world. At the end of the 19th century, the harbour experienced a second flourish. Steam shipping was on the rise and shipbuilding was important for employment. Today, harbour and city are still closely linked. Themes such as area development and housing are high on both agendas. We also look to the future with topics such as energy, sustainability and mobility.

## interactive and in-depth
### In addition to the different objects and paintings, stories are also told through different games. For example, visitors can prepare a ship for departure by "buying" products that are needed for this. And the diversity of the harbour is shown in a game about transshipment, where goods must be brought to their destination as efficiently as possible. In addition, visitors are challenged to think about the future. Via various dilemmas, they can see how certain choices affect both the harbour and the city.

### The harbour has long been one of the city's main employers. Many people from Amsterdam, but also from far beyond, have worked at the harbour. The exhibition tells their story. Who were they? Where did they come from? And what were they doing at the harbour? But even today, tens of thousands of people still work in and around the Amsterdam port. The stories of these people show the connection between harbour and city.

The Arctic Ocean crawled with whales and Willem noticed how easily they were caught. More and more people started whaling, as you could make a lot of money with catching whales. The meat, the oil from the blubber and the whalebones brought in a lot of money on the markets.

## whaling
### In the 19th century the Netherlands stopped whaling. However, when after the Second World War there was a shortage of everything, whaling was resumed. In 1964 the last whaler sailed under the Dutch flag. Environmental movements all around the world were taking action against whaling. Nowadays, whaling meets a lot of resistance. The whale is even in danger of extinction!

## Willem van de velden and Son
### The exhibition Willem van de Velde & Son takes you to the maritime world of the Van de Veldes; it takes you past rough sketches, calm seascapes, dramatic storms and impressive naval battles. Make sure not to miss out; for the first time ever, this large amount of works by both artists can be seen side by side.

### Get to know the artistic talent and entrepreneurship of the van de Veldes. Father and son ran a flourishing and internationally operating family studio for an impressive period of 70 years. The studio belonged to the absolute higher end of the 17th century marine painting. Willem van de Velde de Oude (the Elder) excelled in pen drawings and Willem van de Velde de Jonge (the Younger) in oil painting. Two recently acquired English tapestries designed by Willem van de Velde de Oude are a true showpiece in the exhibition.

### Van de Velde made his sketches on sheets of paper stuck together, which he later worked out as detailed pen drawings in his studio. He took his son Willem out to sea from a very early age to teach him how to observe with a keen eye and to work with a sense of detail.

### Willem van de Velde & Son is an absolute must for devotees of maritime history and seventeenth-century art. Visitors coming to see the superb works on show here will be amazed by the technique, the detail and the image conveyed of the vibrant maritime world of the seventeenth century. The exhibition features around 40 paintings and pen paintings, 35 drawings and two exceptional tapestries: these huge wall-hangings measure no less than 5.87 x 3.30 and 4.57 x 3.30 metres.

### The exhibition reveals how the Van de Veldes built a flourishing international business founded on artistic talent and commercial insight. Rising to the pinnacle of the seventeenth-century world of marine art, father and son Van de Velde made a huge artistic impact. The show presents a detailed picture of the Van de Velde family business, their expertise in maritime art and their extraordinary creative skill. 

### Works are assembled here from collections in the Netherlands and abroad. Major museums such as the Rijksmuseum, Mauritshuis, National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and London’s National Gallery have contributed to the exhibition. Two exceptional exhibits are the enormous tapestries originally commissioned by the English king to designs by the Van de Veldes. 

## inventive and innovative

### For both artists, the sea and its maritime activity were an infinite source of inspiration. Both had their own specialism: Willem van de Velde the Elder (1611-1693) excelled in detailed pen drawings. His son Willem van de Velde the Younger (1633-1707) was "good with color" and made colorful oil paintings. Both father and son were not only talented, but also inventive and entrepreneurial. This made them very successful. The Van de Veldes started a family business around 1650 that flourished for more than seventy years - first from their shop in Amsterdam and later from the English royal court. Thanks to their entrepreneurial spirit, a painting-size pen drawing by Willem van de Velde was an indispensable item for the collections of leading European art collectors, such as the Italian Medici family.

## working at the English royal court

### The so-called disaster year of 1672 wreaked havoc to the family business. The demand for new works of art halted. This marked the start of a new adventure for the Van de Veldes. At the invitation of the English king, they moved to England to work at his royal court. They took up residence in a studio at the royal palace in Greenwich, east of London. The Van de Veldes continued to work there for eleven years in the service of the English royal family, for which they received a generous salary. Willem van de Velde the Younger continued to grow artistically. His paintings of dramatic storms as well as calm seascapes were in great demand.
